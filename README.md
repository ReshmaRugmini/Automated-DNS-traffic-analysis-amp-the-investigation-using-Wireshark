The idea proposed in this project is to develop a comprehensive system for capturing, analysing, and visualizing DNS traffic. The system will enable users to upload network traffic data, which will be captured using Wireshark and analysed using Python. The analysed data will then be visualized on an interactive Django-based dashboard, allowing users to explore and gain insights into DNS query types, response times, and potential security threats through detailed statistical analysis. Here i applying some methods to detect  the chances of DNS attack like Statistical Analysis of Domains and Subdomains, DNS Query length, DNS Record Type Analysis, DNS Signature Analysis, DNS Traffic Volume and Time Analysis and also plotting using charts.
